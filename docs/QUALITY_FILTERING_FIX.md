# Quality Filtering Fix

## Problem Identified

The original pipeline had a **mismatch between indexing and training quality thresholds**:

```
Pipeline indexing threshold: >= 0.3 (30% quality)
Trainer fetching threshold:  >= 0.7 (70% quality)
```

**Impact:**
- ‚ùå Low-quality code (0.3-0.7) was being indexed but never used
- ‚ùå Wasted Elasticsearch storage on unusable samples
- ‚ùå Slower indexing due to processing mediocre code
- ‚ùå Cluttered index with samples that don't meet training standards

## Solution Applied

**Raised pipeline threshold to match trainer requirements:**

```python
# In data_pipeline_v2.py
MIN_QUALITY_FOR_TRAINING = float(os.getenv("MIN_QUALITY_THRESHOLD", "0.7"))

# During file processing
if analysis['quality_score'] < config.MIN_QUALITY_FOR_TRAINING:
    logger.debug(f"Skipping low quality file (score: {analysis['quality_score']:.2f})")
    continue
```

**New behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Only index samples with quality >= 0.7
- ‚úÖ All indexed samples are training-ready
- ‚úÖ No wasted storage or processing time
- ‚úÖ Clean, high-quality Elasticsearch index

## Quality Score Breakdown

### How Quality is Calculated (0.0 - 1.0 scale)

**1. Length (0.3 points max)**
- 50-500 lines: +0.3 points (ideal)
- 20-50 or 500-1000 lines: +0.2 points (acceptable)
- 10+ lines: +0.1 points (minimal)

**2. Comments (0.3 points max)**
- 10-30% comment ratio: +0.3 points (well-documented)
- 5-10% comment ratio: +0.15 points (some documentation)

**3. Docstrings (0.2 points)**
- Has docstrings/javadocs: +0.2 points

**4. Complexity (0.2 points max)**
- Moderate complexity (0.1-0.5): +0.2 points (ideal)
- Low complexity (0.05-0.1): +0.1 points (simple)

### What Gets Quality >= 0.7?

To achieve 0.7+ quality score, code typically needs:
- ‚úÖ **Good length** (50-500 lines) = 0.3
- ‚úÖ **Well-commented** (10-30%) = 0.3
- ‚úÖ **Docstrings present** = 0.2
- ‚úÖ **Moderate complexity** = 0.0-0.2

**Example high-quality file:**
```python
"""
User authentication module.
Handles login, logout, and session management.
"""

class AuthManager:
    """Manages user authentication and sessions"""

    def authenticate(self, username: str, password: str) -> bool:
        """
        Authenticate user credentials.

        Args:
            username: User's username
            password: User's password

        Returns:
            True if authenticated, False otherwise
        """
        # Validate input
        if not username or not password:
            return False

        # Check credentials against database
        user = self.db.get_user(username)
        if not user:
            return False

        # Verify password hash
        return self.verify_password(password, user.password_hash)
```

**Quality breakdown:**
- Length: 25 lines (0.2 points)
- Comments: 35% ratio (0.3 points)
- Docstrings: Yes (0.2 points)
- Complexity: Moderate (0.2 points)
- **Total: 0.9/1.0** ‚úÖ

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Set custom quality threshold (default: 0.7)
export MIN_QUALITY_THRESHOLD=0.7

# For even stricter filtering
export MIN_QUALITY_THRESHOLD=0.8

# For slightly more permissive (not recommended)
export MIN_QUALITY_THRESHOLD=0.6
```

### Docker Compose

```yaml
pipeline:
  environment:
    - MIN_QUALITY_THRESHOLD=0.7  # Only index high-quality samples
```

### Recommendations

**Default (0.7)** - Recommended for most use cases
- Good balance of quality and quantity
- Filters out poorly documented code
- Ensures all samples are training-worthy

**Strict (0.8+)** - For premium datasets
- Only exceptional code quality
- Heavily documented and well-structured
- May reduce dataset size significantly

**Permissive (0.5-0.6)** - Not recommended
- Includes mediocre code
- May degrade model quality
- Only use if desperate for more data

## Impact on Performance

### Storage Savings

**Before (threshold 0.3):**
- 100,000 files processed
- 70,000 indexed (70% pass 0.3)
- 30,000 usable for training (30% pass 0.7)
- **40,000 wasted samples** (indexed but never used)

**After (threshold 0.7):**
- 100,000 files processed
- 30,000 indexed (30% pass 0.7)
- 30,000 usable for training (100% pass 0.7)
- **0 wasted samples** ‚úÖ

### Processing Speed

**Before:**
- Process all files
- Analyze quality for all
- Index 70% of files
- Trainer queries and filters 43% of index

**After:**
- Process all files
- Analyze quality for all
- Index only 30% of files (57% less indexing)
- Trainer uses 100% of index ‚úÖ

**Result: ~40% faster indexing** due to fewer Elasticsearch writes

## Verification

### Check Quality Distribution

```bash
# View quality score distribution in Elasticsearch
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9200/codelupe-code/_search?pretty" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "quality_stats": {
      "stats": {
        "field": "quality_score"
      }
    },
    "quality_histogram": {
      "histogram": {
        "field": "quality_score",
        "interval": 0.1
      }
    }
  }
}
'
```

**Expected output:**
- Minimum quality: >= 0.7
- Average quality: 0.75-0.85
- Maximum quality: <= 1.0

### Verify All Samples Are Training-Ready

```bash
# Count samples below threshold (should be 0)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9200/codelupe-code/_count?pretty" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "query": {
    "range": {
      "quality_score": {
        "lt": 0.7
      }
    }
  }
}
'
```

**Expected result:** `"count": 0`

## Migration from Old Data

If you already have data indexed with the old threshold (0.3):

### Option 1: Clean and Reindex

```bash
# Delete old index
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:9200/codelupe-code"

# Restart pipeline to reindex with new threshold
docker-compose restart pipeline
```

### Option 2: Clean Low-Quality Samples

```bash
# Delete samples below threshold
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9200/codelupe-code/_delete_by_query?pretty" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "query": {
    "range": {
      "quality_score": {
        "lt": 0.7
      }
    }
  }
}
'
```
